        This tool has been a passion project for quite some time.
        Lovingly handcrafted after countless hours of manual labor, with
        the sole purpose of helping Japanese language learners. The goal
        was to be able to visually identify any of the 2,136 常用漢字
        (jouyou kanji), particularly in books, even when you don't know
        how to write nor pronounce them.

    <div class="section">How to Use</div>
    <div class="description">
        For any given kanji region (<img src="assets/kanjiShadedRegionVG/1_left.svg">
        <img src="assets/kanjiShadedRegionVG/2_right.svg">
        <img src="assets/kanjiShadedRegionVG/3_top.svg"> etc...),
        apply matching component filters on the left, then click on any
        resulting kanji to copy it to your clipboard. If a kanji doesn't
        seem to belong to any region, it has probably been catalogued
        under the solid region (<img src="assets/kanjiShadedRegionVG/9_solid.svg">). Numbers
        represent stroke counts. Over time, more components will be
        gradually added for better triangulation.

    <div class="section">Alternative Resources</div>
    <div class="description">
        Many sites and apps rely on freely available, error-prone,
        dictionary and component-based files (JMDict, KRADFile). Many
        kanji components can't be separately typed since they don't have
        their own unicode entries. This tool circumvents this particular
        problem with handcrafted SVG components, raising the bar on
        component accuracy and thereby searching.

                initial kanji character SVG content, from which all
                component and kanji derivations were based.
